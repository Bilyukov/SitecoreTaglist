# Sitecore Taglist

## Sitecore Experience Platform Module

Sitecore Taglist Module introduces new field type to the Content Editor of Sitecore Experience Platform: Taglist.

Sitecore Taglist is a list-typed field and its functionality is very close to the Multilist field.

The advantages that Tagfield gives are:

	1. Autocomplete while typing
	2. User-friendly UI
	3. Improved usability especially when dealing with large collections of source items

Tagfield is based on Chosen – a jQuery plugin:

The installation package (Sitecore module) is located at [Taglist Module](../Sitecore Packages/Taglist-1.0.0.1.zip)

Once the package is installed a new field type called Taglist appears in the Template builder:

Along with the installation package you will find another package [git]\ Sitecore Packages\Taglist-Test-Content-1.0.zip which contains templates and content items that can be used while testing the module.

The module is tested against Sitecore CMS 6.6 + (Sitecore 6.6 – 8.1)

Enjoy!
